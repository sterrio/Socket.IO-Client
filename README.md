# Socket.Io-Client

This client program is a demo application for socket.io and what it can be used for. The library can be found [here.](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io)

## Description 

The application pairs up multiple people and puts them into a chat room where they can send and recieve messages
with each other. Using the socket.io library we can open a TCP connection to continuosly check if there are any new messages being sent for every client.
