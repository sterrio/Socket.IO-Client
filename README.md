# Socket.IO-Client [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
This client program is a demo application for socket.io and what it can be used for. The library can be found [here.](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io)

## Description
The application pairs up multiple people and puts them into a chat room where they can send and recieve messages
with each other. Using the socket.io library we can open a TCP connection to continuosly check if there are any new messages being sent for every client.

## Results
Here you can see the current status of our web app without actually cloning or downloading the project. This may be subject to change moving forward.

## Concept
This is an early concept sketch file of the application before we started implementation. There are various differences in the main version such as color pallete changes, and styles of certain features we decided to change for practicality and other reasons.
